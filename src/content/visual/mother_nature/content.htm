<article><paragraph>   I have always liked nature. It was a place where I could relax. At the time of the pandemic, she was the only reason to leave the house. During the walks, I began to think of nature as a dark force. That’s when my opinion of her changed. It is no longer some good thing that offers humanity all the necessary things, but it can also take them away. With the series, I wanted to show the eternity of nature and something hidden, horrible in it.</paragraph></article>
